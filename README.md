# raptor
Raptor is a game inspiredby the old TRS-80 game Penetrator. I started this game in July, 2023 and it is being currently developed by me with the help from ChatGPT. The main purpose of this project is to learn and study Javascript, because the last time I wrote a Javascript code was in 2007.
