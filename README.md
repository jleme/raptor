# raptor
Raptor is a game inspiredby the old TRS-80 game Penetrator, that I played a lot when I was a kid:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrator_(video_game)

I started this game in July, 2023 and it is being currently developed by me with the help from ChatGPT. The main purpose of this project is to learn and study Javascript (the last time I wrote a Javascript code was in 2007, with the exception of [pig-game](https://github.com/jleme/pig-game)).

Unlike the original game, this game will have its world generated in real time, randomly.
