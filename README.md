# raptor
Raptor is a game inspiredby the old TRS-80 game Penetrator. This game is being currently developed by me with help from ChatGPT. The main purpose of this project is to learn and study Javascript. The last time I wrote a Javascript code was in 2007 (I started writing this game in July, 2023).
